# Asfaleia-or-Modern-Enigma
This is a modern version of enigma machine, written in python and looks almost like an original one.
The only file you would normally use is the main.py, but if you want to shape the machine for youself, than you are welcome.
The machine is preset with five rotors (by default only three are in use), and given values for switchers.
If you want to use more that three rotors follow the logic of the code and code comments to set them right.
For your security concerns, you should always have two additional rotors that are not in use, you can generate shuffle pairs with a file 'pair_gen', it randomly generates pairs of letters that will be swithed in the future, in the list form, so you can copy them and connect with the propriate variable names.
